				  <h5>YHack</h5>
				  <p>36 hour long collegiate hackathon at Yale University where we made Pynt, a program which lets 
users draw out shapes and snippets of code to create Python scripts. Drawings on the tablet site 
symbolize object oriented programs that are sent via web-sockets in real-time to the desktop site 
where they can be edited and run on the online interpreter. More info on <a href = "https://github.com/Pynt/Pynt">github</a>. Also try it out at <a href = "http://pynt.meteor.com/">pynt</a>.</p>

				  <h5>Hack the North</h5> <span class="label success">Winner</span>
				  <p>36 hour long collegiate hackathon at University of Waterloo in Toronto, Canada. We created 
SpaceBowl, a virtual reality bowling game. Utilized the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2, Unity 3D, and 
the Myo gesture controlled armband to model an accurate real-life virtual bowling experience. 
Won the hackathon and also won the BackTrack API prize. More info on <a href = "http://challengepost.com/software/spacebowl-oculus-myo">Challenge Post</a>.</p>

education. We created the 3Draw application which 
modeled mobile gyroscopic movement in a 3D environment on a PC utilizing web sockets, 
Meteor.js, Bootstrap.js, Three.js and a variety of other HTML5/JavaScript frameworks. More info on <a href = "https://github.com/mjkaufer/3draw">github</a>. Also try it out at <a href = "http://www.3-draw.org/">3-draw.org</a>.</p>

					<h5>General</h5>
					<p>My name is <a href = "/">Rushi Shah</a></p>
					<p>I am a junior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (<a href = "http://www.tjhsst.edu/">TJHSST</a>). It is the <a href = "http://www.newsweek.com/2014/09/19/number-1-high-school-america-offers-real-head-start-268693.html">best</a> public high school in the nation.</p>

					<p>I am the outreach coordinator and treasurer for my school's <a href = "https://github.com/TJDevClub">Dev(elopment) Club</a>, council member for my school's Mock Trial Club, co-president for my school's Science and Law Club, and the treasurer for my school's Paleontology Society.</p>

					<p>I've done Model United Nations and Public Forum Debate for about two years each. For Public Forum I was a quarter-finalist at the Metropolitan Region Invitational and I've been to <a href = "http://columbiadebate.org/invitational/invitation">Columbia's</a> Annual Competition. For MUN I have attended numerous local competitions and the Ivy League (<a href = "http://www.ilmunc.com/">ILMUNC</a>), William and Mary (<a href = "https://twitter.com/wmhsmun">WMHSMUN</a>), and Washington Area (<a href = "http://www.wamunc.com/">WAMUNC</a>) Model United Nations Conferences. In MUN and PF I have won a variety of local and national awards.</p>

					<h5>CS Specific</h5>
					<p>I have taken <a href = "/classes">3 years</a> of computer science courses ranging from Data Structures to Artificial Intelligence. I know Java, Python, and Javascript.</p>
					
					<p>I love <a href = "/hackathons">hackathons</a>.</p>

					<p>I interned at the <a href = "http://www.mitre.org/">MITRE Corporation</a> this summer and used Python to create a natural language processing system for parsing data sets from over 12,000 air traffic controller transmissions. I created four call-sign identification algorithms and developed metrics/statistics for use by subject matter experts to report progress to the FAA clients. We also won the <a href = "http://instagram.com/p/rCOaKjIZ-q/">Intern Paper Airplane Competition</a></p>
					<p>I work on side projects in my free time. For example I have been developing with the drone we won at Hack the North <a href = "https://github.com/2016rshah/drone">here</a>, I made a site for THREEjs animations <a href = "http://threejs.meteor.com/">here</a>, and (like most programmers under the age of 20) I had a <a href = "https://github.com/2016rshah/phaser">video-game</a> development phase. For more side projects just check my <a href = "https://github.com/2016rshah">github</a>.</p>
